<p class="info"> The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short,
	rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
	It is sexually dimorphic; male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.  </p>
